# AS-Portfolio

## Description

Newly redesigned portfolio page. Now includes images and links for homework projects: Coding Quiz Challenge, Weather Dashboard App, and Work Day Scheduler. The featured work panel for major projects now features Project 1:  News Flash App. Redesigned the About section so that it is initially hidden and only the work project sections are diplayed on initial load. Clicking the Navbar buttons for About and Work will toggle the content visibility for those sections.
The work sections each have a heading label that will reveal the projects associated with the respective section when the heading is clicked. Each project has a title element that will load the GitHub repository page for that project in a separate tab. Clicking on the image will load published app page in separate tab.
